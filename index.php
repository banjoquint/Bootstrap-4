<!---This is an initial stab at using Bootstrap 4 on a project. The initial idea is to sort out a database, get connected, and using forms and modals process some information in a CRUD way. -->
<!-- Then do the same in Bootstrap 5 -->
<?php 
  require_once 'includes/header.php';
?>
    <h1>Hello, world!</h1>
<?php 
    require_once 'includes/footer.php';
 ?>
